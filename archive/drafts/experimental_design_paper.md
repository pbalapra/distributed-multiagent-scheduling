**Secondary Hypotheses:**
1. **H1:** LLM agents show 20-30% better success rates under complex failure scenarios
2. **H2:** Recovery time correlates inversely with decision quality scores
3. **H3:** Hybrid LLM-heuristic approaches optimize the trade-off between decision quality and response time
4. **H4:** System resilience scales effectively with agent count up to tested limits
5. **H5:** Network topology significantly impacts fault propagation and recovery patterns

### 6. Evaluation Metrics for Technical Paper

#### System-Level Metrics
```python
# Primary Performance Indicators
success_rate = completed_tasks / total_tasks
mttr = mean(recovery_times)
availability = (total_time - downtime) / total_time
decision_quality = mean(quality_scores)

# Efficiency Metrics  
throughput = completed_tasks / experiment_duration
resource_efficiency = successful_operations / resource_consumption
network_efficiency = successful_messages / total_messages

# Scalability Metrics
scalability_factor = performance_at_scale / baseline_performance
degradation_rate = (baseline_perf - scaled_perf) / scale_increase
```

#### Decision Quality Scoring Rubric
