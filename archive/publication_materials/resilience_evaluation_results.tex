\section{Introduction}

Modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems require robust scheduling mechanisms that can maintain operational effectiveness under various failure scenarios, load conditions, and scale requirements. This paper presents experimental validation of distributed multi-agent scheduling resilience compared to traditional centralized approaches across five experimental dimensions: scalability, failure rate tolerance, failure pattern resilience, load pattern adaptability, and high-load performance.

\section{Experimental Results}

\subsection{Scalability Analysis}

The scalability evaluation demonstrates distributed scheduling's superior performance across varying workload sizes and cluster configurations.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure1_scale_job_count.png}
\caption{Scalability analysis showing completion rates across varying job counts. Distributed scheduling maintains 81-93\% completion rates compared to centralized scheduling's 25-82\%, demonstrating superior scalability under increasing workload sizes. Statistical significance: distributed outperforms centralized in all tested configurations (p < 0.001).}
\label{fig:scale_job_count}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure2_scale_agent_count.png}
\caption{Agent count scalability showing completion rates across varying cluster sizes (5-20 agents). Distributed scheduling achieves 89-96\% completion versus centralized 42-67\%, with performance advantages increasing at larger scales. This demonstrates the distributed approach's ability to leverage additional resources effectively.}
\label{fig:scale_agent_count}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:scale_job_count} presents job count scalability results across workloads of 50 to 500 jobs. Distributed scheduling maintains consistently high completion rates (81-93\%) regardless of workload size, while centralized scheduling shows significant performance degradation as job count increases, dropping from 82\% completion at 500 jobs with 20 agents to 25\% with 5 agents.

Figure~\ref{fig:scale_agent_count} demonstrates the impact of cluster size on scheduling performance. The distributed approach shows superior resource utilization, with completion rates improving from 89\% to 96\% as agent count increases. Conversely, centralized scheduling exhibits inconsistent scaling behavior, achieving only 42-67\% completion rates across different cluster sizes.

\subsection{Failure Rate Tolerance}

The failure rate evaluation assesses system resilience under increasing agent failure rates from 5\% to 35\%, representing realistic to pessimistic reliability scenarios.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure3_failure_rate_completion.png}
\caption{Impact of agent failure rates on job completion. Distributed scheduling shows graceful degradation (98\% to 82\%) while centralized scheduling exhibits catastrophic failure (78\% to 28\%) as failure rates increase from 5\% to 35\%. This demonstrates the distributed approach's fault tolerance capabilities under increasing system stress.}
\label{fig:failure_rate_completion}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure4_failure_rate_availability.png}
\caption{System availability versus agent failure rates. Distributed scheduling maintains >90\% availability across all failure scenarios, while centralized availability drops below 85\% at low failure rates and becomes critically low (<42\%) at high failure rates. This illustrates the distributed approach's superior operational continuity.}
\label{fig:failure_rate_availability}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:failure_rate_completion} reveals the stark difference in failure tolerance between approaches. Distributed scheduling demonstrates graceful degradation, maintaining 82\% job completion even at 35\% failure rates. In contrast, centralized scheduling suffers catastrophic performance loss, dropping to 28\% completion under the same conditions—a 66\% performance advantage for the distributed approach.

System availability results in Figure~\ref{fig:failure_rate_availability} show distributed scheduling's operational robustness. The distributed approach maintains >90\% system availability across all tested failure rates, while centralized availability degrades significantly, falling below 42\% at high failure rates.

\subsection{Failure Pattern Resilience}

This evaluation examines system behavior under different failure scenarios: random failures, cascading failures, and network partitions.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure5_failure_pattern_completion.png}
\caption{Completion rates across different failure patterns. Distributed scheduling achieves 87-91\% completion versus centralized 18-52\% across all failure types. Network partition scenarios show the most dramatic difference, with distributed maintaining 89\% completion while centralized drops to 18\%, highlighting the benefits of autonomous agent operation.}
\label{fig:failure_pattern_completion}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure6_failure_pattern_fault_score.png}
\caption{Fault tolerance scores (0-100 composite metric) by failure pattern. Distributed scheduling consistently scores 85-90 across all patterns, while centralized scores vary dramatically (28-62), showing poor consistency. The composite metric includes completion rate (50\%), agent reliability (20\%), and scheduler failures (30\%).}
\label{fig:failure_pattern_fault_score}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:failure_pattern_completion} demonstrates distributed scheduling's resilience across diverse failure scenarios. Network partition conditions reveal the most significant advantage, with distributed scheduling maintaining 89\% completion while centralized performance collapses to 18\%—a direct consequence of the single point of failure inherent in centralized architectures.

The fault tolerance analysis in Figure~\ref{fig:failure_pattern_fault_score} employs a composite metric weighting completion rate (50\%), agent reliability (20\%), and scheduler failures (30\%). Distributed scheduling achieves consistent scores of 85-90 across all failure patterns, while centralized scores range widely from 28-62, indicating poor reliability consistency.

\subsection{Load Pattern Adaptability}

Load pattern evaluation tests system performance under different job arrival patterns: constant, burst, and Poisson distributions.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure7_load_pattern_completion.png}
\caption{Completion rates across different load patterns. Distributed scheduling maintains 89-94\% completion across all arrival patterns, while centralized performance varies significantly (34-58\%), showing poor adaptability to workload variations. Burst patterns cause the most significant centralized performance degradation.}
\label{fig:load_pattern_completion}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure8_load_pattern_throughput.png}
\caption{System throughput (jobs per time unit) across load patterns. Distributed scheduling achieves consistently high throughput (4.2-4.7 jobs/time) while centralized throughput varies significantly (1.9-2.8 jobs/time). The distributed approach shows 67-147\% throughput advantage depending on load pattern.}
\label{fig:load_pattern_throughput}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:load_pattern_completion} shows distributed scheduling's superior adaptability to varying workload characteristics. While distributed completion rates remain stable (89-94\%) across all patterns, centralized performance varies dramatically, particularly under burst conditions where completion drops to 34\%.

Throughput analysis in Figure~\ref{fig:load_pattern_throughput} reveals distributed scheduling's consistent high performance (4.2-4.7 jobs/time) versus centralized variability (1.9-2.8 jobs/time), representing a 67-147\% throughput advantage depending on load characteristics.

\subsection{High-Load Stress Testing}

Extreme load testing evaluates system behavior under burst conditions ranging from 50 to 400 concurrent jobs.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure9_high_load_completion.png}
\caption{High load performance showing completion rates under extreme burst conditions. At 400 concurrent jobs, distributed scheduling maintains 75\% completion while centralized drops to 3\%—a 25x performance advantage. This demonstrates distributed scheduling's superior scalability under stress conditions.}
\label{fig:high_load_completion}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure10_high_load_availability.png}
\caption{System availability under high load stress testing. Distributed scheduling maintains >70\% availability even at maximum load (400 jobs), while centralized availability collapses to <10\% under the same conditions. This illustrates the distributed approach's operational resilience under extreme stress.}
\label{fig:high_load_availability}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:high_load_completion} presents the most dramatic performance difference observed in our evaluation. Under extreme load (400 concurrent jobs), distributed scheduling maintains 75\% completion while centralized performance collapses to 3\%—representing a 25-fold performance advantage.

System availability under stress (Figure~\ref{fig:high_load_availability}) shows distributed scheduling's operational resilience, maintaining >70\% availability at maximum load while centralized availability drops below 10\%.

\subsection{Overall Performance Summary}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figure11_win_rates.png}
\caption{Summary of distributed scheduler performance across all experimental categories. Win rates range from 92\% to 100\%, with an overall advantage of 96.2\% across 26 test configurations. This demonstrates consistent superiority in fault-tolerant scheduling across all evaluated dimensions with statistical significance p < 0.001.}
\label{fig:win_rates}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:win_rates} summarizes the comprehensive evaluation results across all experimental dimensions. Distributed scheduling achieves win rates of 92-100\% in each category, with perfect scores (100\%) in failure rate tolerance, failure pattern resilience, load pattern adaptability, and high-load performance.

\section{Conclusion}

This comprehensive experimental evaluation across 26 test configurations demonstrates the clear superiority of distributed multi-agent scheduling for resilient high-performance computing. With a 96.2\% win rate, average performance advantage of +47.1\%, and statistical significance of p < 0.001, the evidence strongly supports the adoption of distributed scheduling approaches for fault-tolerant HPC systems.

The most compelling results emerge under stress conditions, where distributed scheduling maintains 75\% job completion at extreme loads while centralized approaches collapse to 3\% completion. This 25-fold performance advantage, combined with graceful degradation under increasing failure rates, positions distributed scheduling as the optimal choice for mission-critical HPC environments requiring robust operational continuity.
