# Experimental Campaign: LLM-Enhanced Distributed Consensus for HPC Job Scheduling

## Abstract

This document outlines a comprehensive experimental campaign to evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced distributed consensus protocols for High-Performance Computing (HPC) job scheduling. The campaign addresses four key research questions through systematic experimentation across multiple dimensions.

## 1. Research Questions & Hypotheses

### RQ1: LLM Intelligence vs. Heuristic Performance
**Question**: Do LLM-enhanced agents significantly outperform traditional heuristic-based agents in distributed consensus scenarios?

**Hypothesis**: LLM-enhanced agents will achieve 15-25% higher consensus success rates and 20-30% faster convergence times compared to heuristic agents due to superior context understanding and adaptive reasoning.

**Metrics**: Consensus success rate, convergence time, decision quality score, resource utilization efficiency

### RQ2: Consensus Protocol Effectiveness
**Question**: Which consensus protocols perform best under different LLM agent configurations and fault conditions?

**Hypothesis**: Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols will show superior performance under adversarial conditions, while Raft will excel in crash-failure scenarios. Weighted voting will demonstrate the highest efficiency with specialized LLM agents.

**Metrics**: Fault tolerance score, recovery time, throughput under stress, scalability limits

### RQ3: Agent Specialization Impact
**Question**: How does domain specialization (GPU, Memory, Compute, Storage) affect consensus quality and system performance?

**Hypothesis**: Specialized agents will improve decision accuracy by 30-40% for domain-specific workloads while maintaining comparable performance for general workloads.

**Metrics**: Domain-specific accuracy, cross-domain performance, specialization benefit ratio

### RQ4: Scalability and Fault Resilience
**Question**: How do LLM-enhanced consensus systems scale with increasing numbers of agents and fault injection intensity?

**Hypothesis**: LLM systems will maintain >80% performance at 50+ agents and >70% performance under 40% fault rates, outperforming heuristic systems by 20-30% in high-stress scenarios.

**Metrics**: Agent scalability limits, fault tolerance thresholds, performance degradation curves
