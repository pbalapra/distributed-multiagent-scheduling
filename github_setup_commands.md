# GitHub Repository Setup Commands

## Replace USERNAME with your actual GitHub username, then run these commands:

```bash
# 1. Add remote repository (REPLACE 'USERNAME' with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/distributed-multiagent-scheduling.git

# 2. Verify remote connection
git remote -v

# 3. Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: If you want to use SSH instead of HTTPS:

```bash
# 1. Add remote repository with SSH (REPLACE 'USERNAME' with your GitHub username)  
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/distributed-multiagent-scheduling.git

# 2. Verify remote connection
git remote -v

# 3. Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## After successful push, your repository will contain:

✅ **63 files committed** with comprehensive documentation
✅ **Complete package structure** ready for installation
✅ **Automated evaluation scripts** for reproducibility  
✅ **Publication-ready figures** and results
✅ **Professional README** with badges and examples
✅ **MIT License** and contribution guidelines

## Next Steps After Push:

1. **Add repository topics** on GitHub:
   - `distributed-systems`
   - `multi-agent-systems` 
   - `high-performance-computing`
   - `job-scheduling`
   - `fault-tolerance`
   - `research`
   - `python`

2. **Create repository description**:
   > "Distributed Multi-Agent Scheduling for Resilient HPC - Research implementation with 96.2% win rate over centralized approaches"

3. **Enable GitHub Pages** (optional):
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from branch → main → / (root)
   - This will make your documentation accessible via web

4. **Add repository URL to paper**:
   - Update citations to include: `https://github.com/USERNAME/distributed-multiagent-scheduling`

5. **Create first release**:
   - Go to Releases → Create new release
   - Tag: `v1.0.0`
   - Title: `Initial Release - Distributed Multi-Agent Scheduling v1.0.0`
   - Description: Copy from README key features section
